# Standard-ML-Functional-Programming-Computer-Science-Project
Efficient functional programming for financial applications using Standard ML and recursive logic.

This repository contains an implementation of efficient and scalable functional programming techniques using the Standard ML language. The project focuses on the use of recursive logic to create code that is both elegant and efficient for use in financial applications, including market trading.

The implementation offers a flexible and powerful framework for designing and implementing complex financial models, using a combination of functional programming techniques and recursive logic. By leveraging these techniques, the code is able to handle complex financial calculations with speed and accuracy, making it an ideal solution for use in real-world financial applications.

Overall, this project showcases the power and flexibility of functional programming, and demonstrates the value of recursive logic in creating efficient and scalable code. Whether you are a student, researcher, or practitioner in the field of finance, this project offers a valuable resource for exploring the benefits of functional programming in financial applications.
